The files had to be built with BumbleBee on the virtual machine, but for some reason they are on "read-only" permissions.
I couldn't import the .o file that i made running with "bee run" command.

To create a new example follow the steps of creating a program with Bumblebee.
To see the behaviour of each program go in the "tutorial examples" folder.

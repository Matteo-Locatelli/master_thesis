Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), an originally Unix-based packet filtering technology, has evolved into a versatile tool with significant impact on network performance and security. This master thesis aims to explore the story of BPF, tracing its development from its inception on Unix-based systems to its adaptation on Windows platforms. Through a comparative analysis, we investigate the challenges, solutions and advancements that have led to the successful integration of BPF in the Windows environment. By studying its history, architecture and 
programs development, we explore the potential of BPF to revolutionize network engineering on Windows and contribute to the broader understanding of cross-platform technology adoption.
